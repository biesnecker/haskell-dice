A simple command line utility to roll dice, written to play around with Haskell.

* Usage

./dice x y

where x and y are numbers, in the format xDy -- x is the number of dice to roll, and y is the number of sides the rolled die has.

For example, the standard two six-sided dice in Monopoly would be rolled like this: ./dice 2 6

The result is each individual die's value, and a sum.
